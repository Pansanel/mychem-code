The Mychem Project
==================

Mychem is a chemoinformatics extension for MySQL. This extension
provides a set of functions that handles chemical data within the MySQL
(or MariaDB) database. Mychem is based on `Open Babel <http://openbabel.org/wiki/Main_Page>`_.
As Open Babel is a high-quality software in chemoinformatics, Mychem
provides reliable and fast functions. These functions permit you to
search, analyze and convert chemical data.

More information are available from the `Mychem Website <http://mychem.github.io>`_.
